        <p>Kimchijeon, or kimchi jeon (김치전), is a type of Korean savory pancake that’s made with kimchi.It’s also called kimchi buchimgae (김치부침개). Enjoy these deliciously crispy kimchi pancakes as a snack, appetizer, or a light meal!</p>
       <p>If you have nicely fermented kimchi and some flour, you can make this popular snack in no time. The flavor-packed sour kimchi does a wonder when it’s fried in a simple batter. Everything else is nice to have, but not absolutely necessary.</p></center>
       <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
       <p><ul>
            <li>1 cup thinly sliced fully-fermented kimchi</li>
            <li>1 to 2 scallions</li>
            <li>1/4 medium onion</li>
            <li>3 ounces minced pork, canned tuna (without the liquid), or squid cut into small strips - optional</li>
            <li>cooking oil with high smoke point for pan frying</li></ul>
        <p><h4>Batter</h4></p>
        <p><ul>
            <li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour or buchimgaru (Korean pancake premix)</li>
            <li>2 to 3 tablespoons juice/liquid from kimchi</li>
            <li>1 or 2 teaspoons gochujang</li>
            <li>1 lightly beaten egg - optional</li>
            <li>1 cup icy cold water <em>Use more water if juice/liquid from kimchi is unavailable and not using an egg. Flour to liquid should be about 1:1 ratio in total.</li>
            </ul></em></p>
    
            <p><h4>Optional Dipping Sauce (Combine all the ingredeints)   </h4></p>
            <p><ul>
                <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vinegar</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon sugar</li>
                <li>pinch of black pepper   </li>
                </ul></em></p>    
        <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
        <p><ol>
            <li>Thinly slice the kimchi, about 1/2-inch thick. Cut the scallions into about 2-inch pieces. If the white part is thick, cut in half lengthwise. Thinly slice the onion.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the flour (or pancake mix) with the liquid from kimchi, the optional gochujang/gochugaru and egg, and water, a little bite at a time. Start with dissolving the gochujang with water, and mix everything together. Do not over mix.</li>
            <li>Add a little more water if the batter is too thick. The batter should flow easily from a spoon.
            </li>
            <li>Stir in the kimchi, scallions, onion and the optional protein of your choice.</li>
            <li>Heat one tablespoon of oil in a non-stick pan over medium heat. Ladle the mixture into the pan, and spread it evenly into a thin round shape. Cook until the edges turn light golden brown, about 3 minutes. Turn it over, and add more oil to the sides of the pan. Gently swirl the pan to distribute the oil under the pancakes. Press the pancake down with a spatula. Cook until the other side is nicely browned and crispy, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Repeat the process until there is no remaining batter. Serve hot with a dipping sauce, if desired.</li>
